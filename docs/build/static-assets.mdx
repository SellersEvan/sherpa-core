# Static Assets
SherpaJS servers can serve static assets such as images, CSS, JavaScript
files, and other resources that do not change frequently. These assets are
placed in a dedicated folder within your project and are served directly to
clients when requested.

This static asset directory is optional. Static assets are not transferred from
modules.  


<br/>


## Defining Static Assets Directory
The default directory for static assets in a SherpaJS project is the `public`
folder. Any files placed in this folder are accessible via a URL path that
mirrors the directory structure within `public`.


<br/>


## Serving Static Assets
To serve static assets, simply place the files within the `public`
directory of your project. For example:

```plaintext
/your-project
│
├── /public
│   ├── /images
│   │   └── logo.png
│   ├── /css
│   │   └── styles.css
│   └── /js
│       └── script.js
│
├── /routes
│   └── view.html
└── sherpa.server.ts
```

In this structure:
  * `logo.png` will be accessible at `/images/logo.png`
  * `styles.css` will be accessible at `/css/styles.css`
  * `script.js` will be accessible at `/js/script.js`
  * `view.html` will be accessible at `/`


<br/>


## Examples


### View Endpoints Example
If you want to reference these static assets in your view endpoint or other
files, use the appropriate URL path. For example, in an HTML file:

```html title="/routes/view.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My SherpaJS App</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <img src="/images/logo.png" alt="Logo">
    </header>
    <main>
        <h1>Welcome to My SherpaJS App</h1>
        <p>This is a simple example of serving static assets.</p>
        <script src="/js/script.js"></script>
    </main>
</body>
</html>
```


<br/>


## Security Considerations
  * **Access Control** - Ensure that sensitive files are not placed in the
    `public` directory as they will be publicly accessible.


<br/>


By organizing your static assets efficiently and using SherpaJS's built-in
capabilities, you can serve these resources effectively to enhance the
performance and usability of your web applications.
