## Environment Variables
Environment variables are a key part of configuring your SherpaJS application.
They allow you to set various configuration options and secrets without
hardcoding them into your application's codebase.

### Loading Environment Variables
SherpaJS uses the `.env` file to load environment variables. This file should
be placed at the root of your project. When the system is compiled, the
variables defined in this file are automatically loaded into your server's
environment.

Any environment variables provided by hosting services (such as Vercel or AWS)
are automatically included in your build.

Environment varibles can also be added during build with the
[build command](/api/cli#build-command).

### Automatic Parsing
SherpaJS automatically parses environment variables to their appropriate types:
- Strings remain as strings
- Booleans are converted to `true` or `false`
- Numbers are converted to numeric values


<br/>


### Example .env File
Here is an example of a `.env` file:

```shell title=".env"
PORT=3000                                         # number
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase # string
JWT_SECRET=myverysecretkey                        # string
ENABLE_FEATURE_X=true                             # boolean
MAX_CONNECTIONS=100                               # number
```

<br/>


### Best Practices
- **Security**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Add it
    to your `.gitignore` file.
- **Defaults**: Provide sensible default values for environment variables
    in your code.
- **Validation**: Validate the presence and format of critical environment
    variables at the start of your application to avoid runtime errors.
