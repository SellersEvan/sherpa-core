# Building a Module
Building a SherpaJS module is straightforward and can be accomplished in just a
few steps. Modules allow you to encapsulate and share functionality across
multiple SherpaJS applications. Here's how to get started:


<br/>


## Quick Installation
We recommend starting with the
[SherpaJS Module Template](https://github.com/sellersindustry/SherpaJS-template-module),
which provides a pre-configured structure and example endpoints. After
downloading the template, install all dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install
```

You can start the development server with `npm run dev`.

Now your project is all setup, explore around the project files and get
acquainted with the [SherpaJS Project Structure](/structure) and
[SherpaJS CLI](/api/cli).


<br/>


## Manual Installation
Creating a new module is extremely easy and can be done within a couple of
minutes. To manually create a new module start by create a new NodeJS project
with `npm init`. Then install the SherpaJS Core package:

```sh
npm install sherpa-core
```


<br/>



### Updating `package.json`
Open the `package.json` file in the root directory of your project, and
update the following properties.

```json title="package.json"
{
    "type": "module",
	"exports": "./sherpa.module.ts",
    "scripts": {
        "build": "sherpa build -b Vercel",
        "build-local": "sherpa build -b local",
        "start": "sherpa start",
        "dev": "sherpa dev",
        "test": "echo \"no test specified\""
    }
}
```


<br/>

### Creating Module Config
Create a [module config](/build/module-config) file named `sherpa.module.ts` in
the root directory of your module. This file will default export a module
configuration.

```typescript title="sherpa.module.ts"
import { SherpaJS, CreateModuleInterface } from "sherpa-core";

export type Schema = { foo: boolean, bar: string };

export default SherpaJS.New.module({
    name: "example-module",
    interface: CreateModuleInterface<Schema>()
});
```

[Learn more about module configs](/build/module-config).


<br/>


### Creating Server Config
Create a new Typescript file for your [server configuration](/build/server-config)
in the root directory of your project named `sherpa.server.ts`. *Technically a
server config is not required to create a module, but it is to test the module*.

```typescript title="sherpa.server.ts"
import { SherpaJS } from "sherpa-core";
import { Schema } from "../sherpa.module.ts";

export default SherpaJS.New.server<Schema>({
    context: {
        example: "foo"
    }
});
```

The context you provide the server should match the context schema for your module.


### Creating Endpoints
SherpaJS uses a directory-based structure for routing, similar to NextJS. Start
by creating a `/routes` directory and place a new enpoint `index.ts` file in the
directory. This will be processed at the root `/` of your application.

```typescript title="routes/index.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "sherpa-core";
import { Schema } from "../sherpa.module.ts"

export function GET(request:Request, context:Schema) {
    return Response.text("Hello World!");
}
```

### Details
While the routes of your module are available on a server when the module is
loaded, other assets like the `public` directory are not available. Keep this
in mind when designing your module.


<br/>


### Share Your Module
Share your module with the world by deploying it as an NPM package and
submitting a
[new issue](https://github.com/sellersindustry/SherpaJS/issues/new/choose)
to get it listed as a SherpaJS Community module.

**Important Notes**
  * Ensure your module is deployed as an NPM package.
  * Include documentation on how to set it up, including required properties.
  * Link to the SherpaJS documentation for users to understand how to set it up.
