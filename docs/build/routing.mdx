# Routing
SherpaJS provides a flexible and intuitive way to define endpoints and handle
incoming requests within your microservice architecture. Drawing inspiration
by Next.js, SherpaJS routes follow a directory-based structure located in
the `/routes` directory of your module.


## Terminology

### Route Component Tree
    * **Routes**: A hierarchical structure for all the segments and endpoints
        of the server.
    * **Subroutes**: A subsection of the route structure.
    * **Root**: The first level of segments and endpoints in a route or subroute.


<br/>


### URL Anatomy
    * **Segment**: The directory name part of the URL path delimited by slashes.
    * **URL Path**: The part of the URL that comes after the domain, composed of segments.
    * **Endpoint**: The final destination in the route structure where the request
        is handled, typically defined in `index.ts` files.


<br/>


## Structure of Routes
In the `/routes` directory, you can create directories to organize your
routes. Each endpoint within a route is represented by a file typically named
`index.ts`, [learn more about other types of endpoints](/build/endpoints).

### Example Route Structure
```plaintext
/routes
│
├── /users
│   └── index.ts     // Endpoint logic for "/users"
│
│
├── /example
│   ├── index.ts     // Endpoint logic for "/example"
│   ├── /subroute
│   │   └── index.ts // Endpoint logic for "/example/subroute"
│
├── /[id]
│   └── index.ts     // Endpoint logic for "/[id]" access "[id]" with request.params.path.get("id")
│
├── /products
│   ├── index.ts     // Endpoint logic for "/products"
│   ├── /[productID]
│   │   └── index.ts // Endpoint logic for "/products/[productID]" access "[productID]" with request.params.path.get("productID")
│   └── /category
│       └── index.ts // Endpoint logic for "/products/category"
```

## Defining Segment routes
Routes in SherpaJS are created using a file-system based router where folders
define segment routes, and files inside these folders define the endpoint logic.


<br/>


### Basic Segment Route
In SherpaJS, the basic segment routes are straightforward. Each folder
represents a route segment, and the `index.ts` file within the folder
contains the endpoint logic, [or other types of endpoints](/build/endpoints).

```typescript title="routes/index.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "sherpa-core";

export function GET(request:Request) {
    return Response.text("Hello World!");
}
```


<br/>


### Nested Segment Route
To create a nested segment route, nest folders inside each other. For example, to
create a `/dashboard/settings` route, you would nest two folders like so:

```plaintext
/routes
│
├── /dashboard
│   ├── index.ts // Endpoint logic for "/dashboard"
│   └── /settings
│       └── index.ts // Endpoint logic for "/dashboard/settings"
```

```typescript title="routes/dashboard/settings/index.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "sherpa-core";

export function GET(request:Request) {
    return Response.text("Hello World!");
}
```


<br/>


### Dynamic Segment Route
To define a dynamic segment route, name a directory using square brackets, such
as `[id]`. Within a dynamic segment route directory, you can access the parameter
value from the request object in your endpoint logic. For example, if you have
a dynamic segement route named `[id]`, you can access the parameter
using `request.params.path.get("id")`.

```plaintext
/routes
│
├── /products
│   └── /[id]
│       └── index.ts // Endpoint logic for "/products/[id]"
```

```typescript title="routes/products/[id]/index.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "sherpa-core";

export function GET(request:Request) {
    return Response.new(request.params.path.get("id"));
}
```


<br/>


## Restrictions
The SherpaJS routing system has some restrictions when it comes to defining
routes, these restrictions help to keep routing simple, consistent, and ensure
best practices. The SherpaJS compiler will prevent you from compiling if you
violate any of these restrictions.
    * Multiple [dynamic segement routes](/build/routing#dynamic-segment-route)
        are not allowed in a single segement route.
    * Additional segment routes or endpoints are not allowed as the segment where
        a [Module Endpoint](/build/endpoints#module-endpoint) is loaded.

## Next Steps
Now that you understand the fundamentals of routing in SherpaJS, you can start
creating endpoints for your application. \
