# Installation
Installing SherpaJS and creating a new SherpaJS Server.


<br/>


## Quick Installation
We recommend starting a new SherpaJS server by downloading the
[SherpaJS Server Template](https://github.com/sellersindustry/SherpaJS-template-server).
This template will have all the required structure and example
endpoints setup for you. After download the project, install all the
dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
```

You can start the development server with `npm run dev`.

Now your project is all setup, explore around the project files and get
acquainted with the [SherpaJS Project Structure](/structure) and
[SherpaJS CLI](/api/cli).


<br/>


## Manual Installation
Creating a new server is extremely easy and can be done within a couple of
minutes. To manually create a new server start by create a new NodeJS project
with `npm init`. Then install the SherpaJS Core package:

```bash
npm install sherpa-core
```

<br/>


### Updating `package.json`
Open the `package.json` file in the root directory of your project, and update
the following properties.

```json title="package.json"
{
    "type": "module",
    "scripts": {
        "build": "sherpa build -b Vercel",
        "build-local": "sherpa build -b local",
        "start": "sherpa start",
        "dev": "sherpa dev"
    }
}
```


<br/>


### Creating Server Config
Create a new Typescript file for your [server configuration](/build/server-config)
in the root directory of your project named `sherpa.server.ts`.

```typescript title="sherpa.server.ts"
import { SherpaJS } from "sherpa-core";

export default SherpaJS.New.server({
    context: { // optional, provide a context that are provided to endpoints
        example: "foo"
    }
});
```


<br/>


### Creating Endpoints
SherpaJS uses a directory-based structure for routing, similar to NextJS. Start
by creating a `/routes` directory and place a new enpoint `index.ts` file in the
directory. This will be processed at the root `/` of your application.

```typescript title="/routes/index.ts"
import { Request, Response, Context } from "sherpa-core";

export function GET(request:Request, context:Context) {
    return Response.text("Hello World!");
}
```

### Creating Static Assets (Optional)
Create a `/public` directory in the root directory of your project to store
static assets such as images, stylings and more.
